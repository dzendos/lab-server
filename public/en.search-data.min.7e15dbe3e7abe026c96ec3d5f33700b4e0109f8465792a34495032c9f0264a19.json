Universal logic gates are important because they can be used to simplify the design of digital circuits. By using universal logic gates, engineers can reduce the number of different types of gates that need to be used in a circuit. This can make the circuit more efficient and easier to design.\nWhat states the Amdahl\u0026#39;s law? What is the formula for Amdahl\u0026#39;s law?
